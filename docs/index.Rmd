## About the class

This class is part of a discipline at the university that teaches R for social sciences graduate students.
In this discipline, the teacher already taught how to import data to R, how to manipulate data, create simple graphs, and the current content is how to make reproducible reports.  
In the last class, the teacher made an introduction about how to do the analysis in a reproducible way using R Markdown.
In this class, the students will learn how to add figures in the reports.
